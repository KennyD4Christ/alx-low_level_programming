# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. These programs serve as examples to help you understand the basics of conditional statements and loops in C.

## List of Programs

1. **0-positive_or_negative.c**: This program generates a random number and determines if it's positive, negative, or zero.

2. **1-last_digit.c**: This program prints the last digit of a given number and checks its properties.

3. **2-print_alphabet.c**: A simple program that prints the lowercase alphabet in ascending order.

4. **3-print_alphabets.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in lowercase and uppercase.

5. **4-print_alphabt.c**: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet except for 'q' and 'e'.

6. **5-print_numbers.c**: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0.

7. **6-print_numberz.c**: Similar to the previous program but using only putchar for printing.

8. **7-print_tebahpla.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

9. **8-print_base16.c**: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

10. **9-print_comb.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

11. **10-print_comb2.c**: A program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need a C compiler like GCC and an environment where you can compile and execute C code, such as a Linux terminal.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by running the following command:

```shell
gcc --version
