# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings

## Introduction

This project is part of a series of tasks designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. In this project, you will continue to explore these concepts, building on your previous knowledge.

## Directory Structure

- The source code for this project can be found in the `0x07-pointers_arrays_strings` directory.

## Project Tasks

This project consists of a series of tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of C programming. The tasks included in this project may cover topics such as pointers, arrays, strings, and their manipulation.
