# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on further understanding and implementing singly linked lists in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating and manipulating singly linked lists to solve various problems.

## Project Tasks

1. **0. Print list**
   - Function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.

2. **1. List length**
   - Function that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.

3. **2. Add node**
   - Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list.

4. **3. Add node at the end**
   - Function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.

5. **4. Free list**
   - Function that frees a `listint_t` list.

6. **5. Free**
   - Function that frees a `listint_t` list with a given head pointer.

7. **6. Pop**
   - Function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list and returns the head node's data.

8. **7. Get node at index**
   - Function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list.

9. **8. Sum list**
   - Function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` linked list.

10. **9. Insert**
    - Function that inserts a new node at a given position in a `listint_t` list.

11. **10. Delete at index**
    - Function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `listint_t` linked list.

12. **11. Reverse list**
    - Function that reverses a `listint_t` linked list.

## Requirements

- All code should be written in C.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
- Please use this file for providing information about your project.
