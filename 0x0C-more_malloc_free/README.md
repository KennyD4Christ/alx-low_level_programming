# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Description
This project is part of the "Low-Level Programming" curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on advanced memory management in C using dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and memory deallocation with `free`.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding dynamic memory allocation in C.
- Properly allocating and freeing memory using `malloc` and `free`.
- Implementing a variety of memory allocation functions.
- Handling memory errors and edge cases.
- Implementing custom memory management functions.

## Compilation
Your code will be compiled using the following command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o program


## Files
- `0-malloc_checked.c`: A function that allocates memory using `malloc`.
- `1-string_nconcat.c`: A function that concatenates two strings.
- `2-calloc.c`: A function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc`.
- `3-array_range.c`: A function that creates an array of integers.
- `100-realloc.c`: A custom implementation of the `realloc` function.
