## Description

The main goal of this project is to learn how to work with command-line arguments in C. By the end of this project, you should be comfortable with:

- Accessing and using the `argc` and `argv` parameters.
- Parsing command-line arguments.
- Handling various scenarios and error conditions.
- Creating C programs that accept and process user input from the command line.

## Directory Contents

- **0-holberton.c:** A simple program that prints "Holberton" to the standard output.

- **1-args.c:** A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

- **2-args.c:** A program that prints all the arguments it receives.

- **3-mul.c:** A program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments.

- **4-add.c:** A program that adds positive numbers passed as arguments.

- **100-change.c:** A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount.

## Usage

You can compile the C programs in this directory using a C compiler. Here's a basic example of how to compile and run a C program:

```shell
gcc -o my_program my_program.c
./my_program
