## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on the concepts of dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language using `malloc` and `free`. It involves tasks that require memory allocation and deallocation, understanding how the heap memory works, and implementing functions like `malloc` and `free`.

## Project Directory

- The project directory for this repository is named `0x0B-malloc_free`.

## Requirements

- The code is written in C.
- The use of global variables is not allowed.
- The standard library functions like `malloc` and `free` are allowed for memory allocation and deallocation.
- All header files are located in the `0x0B-malloc_free` directory.

## Usage

To compile the code, you can use a C compiler, such as GCC. Here's an example of how to compile a C file:

```sh
gcc -o my_program file.c
