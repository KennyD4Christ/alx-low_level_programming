## Project Description

In this project, you will work on several C functions, following specific coding style guidelines and restrictions. Your goal is to build functions that perform various tasks, such as checking for uppercase characters, computing the absolute value of an integer, and more.

This project emphasizes the importance of clean and readable code, as it will be checked using the Betty style checker, among other requirements mentioned in the project guidelines.

## Project Requirements

- All code should be written in C and compiled using `gcc` with specific options.
- Follow the Betty style guidelines for code formatting.
- Avoid using global variables.
- No more than five functions per file.
- You are not allowed to use standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- You can use `_putchar` for output.

## File Descriptions

- The project contains various C source code files that implement the required functions, such as `_isupper.c`, `_abs.c`, and more.
- The `main.h` header file contains the function prototypes.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops.git
