## Introduction

Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science.
This project focuses on creating and manipulating singly linked lists in the
C programming language. It covers basic operations such as
insertion, deletion, and traversal of linked lists.

## Directory Structure

- `0-print_list.c`: Function to print all the elements of a linked list.
- `1-list_len.c`: Function to return the number of elements in a linked list.
- `2-add_node.c`: Function to add a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
- ... (add more files as needed)

## Usage

To use the functions in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the "0x12-singly_linked_lists" directory:

    ```bash
    cd alx-low_level_programming/0x12-singly_linked_lists
    ```

3. Compile the C files:

    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_lists
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./linked_lists
    ```

## Compilation

You can compile the C files using the provided Makefile. Simply run the following command:

```bash
make all
