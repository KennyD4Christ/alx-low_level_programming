# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Overview

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on the fundamental concept of preprocessing in the C programming language. The preprocessor is an essential tool in C development that performs tasks like macro expansion, file inclusion, conditional compilation, and more. Understanding how the preprocessor works is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable C code.

## Directory Structure

The project files are organized in the following directory structure:

0x0D-preprocessor/
├── 0-object_like_macro.h
├── 0-main.c
├── 1-pi.h
├── 1-main.c
├── 2-main.c
├── 3-function_like_macro.h
├── 3-main.c
├── 4-sum.h
├── 4-main.c
├── README.md

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each with its own specific objectives. Here's a list of the tasks and their respective header and source files:

1. **0. Object-like Macro**
   - Files:
     - `0-object_like_macro.h`
     - `0-main.c`

2. **1. Pi**
   - Files:
     - `1-pi.h`
     - `1-main.c`

3. **2. File name**
   - Files:
     - `2-main.c`

4. **3. Function-like Macro**
   - Files:
     - `3-function_like_macro.h`
     - `3-main.c`

5. **4. SUM**
   - Files:
     - `4-sum.h`
     - `4-main.c`

## How to Use

To compile and run the code for each task, you can use a C compiler such as `gcc`. For example, to compile the code for task 0, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc 0-main.c -o 0-object
